        Welcome to Asylum! Asylum is a series of fast-paced hardware based YSWS in which you design a schematic for a project,
        turn it into a pcb, write code to power your device, and often design a case or enclosure to be 3D printed. 
        Because these are so fast, they will often have different requirements and not all projects will include all of these.
